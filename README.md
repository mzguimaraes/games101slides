Flashcard app to help Games 101 students at NYU study for their final exam!  (Fall 2015)

This is also the first project I've posted on Github, so that's exciting.
This CLI program is far from perfect.  I would've put more time into polishing it, but I have finals to study for.

TO USE:

--Ensure Python is installed on your computer. 
  
--Download games101cards.py and the plaintext key games file, make sure they're in the same folder.
  
--Run the file.  If you don't know how to do that, the easiest way is to open it in IDLE (a program packaged with Python) and hit F5.
  
--Enjoy!  Make sure to read the instructions that pop up.

Made use of PDFMiner (https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) to convert the PDF games list to the plaintext one packaged here.

Still working on compatibility.  If this doesn't work on your computer please let me know!

Requires Python, tested on version 2.7 on Mac OSX.  I'm aiming for full cross-compatibility.

TODO: package this into an app so non-programmers don't have to install Python
