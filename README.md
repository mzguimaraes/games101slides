Flashcard app to help Games 101 students at NYU study for their final exam!  (Fall 2015)

This is also the first project I've posted on Github, so that's exciting.
This CLI program is far from perfect.  I would've put more time into polishing it, but I have finals to study for.

Made use of PDFMiner (https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) to convert the PDF games list to the plaintext one packaged here.

Still working on compatibility.  If this doesn't work on your computer please let me know!

Requires Python, tested on version 2.7 on Mac OSX.  I'm aiming for full cross-compatibility.
